*`cache_selfie` helps you build fast deterministic tests even if they contain slow non-deterministic components. A generative AI example is available [here](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/blob/main/python/example-pytest-selfie/tests/cache_test.py).*

To use `expect_selfie`, you pass a _value_ that you want to snapshot.

```python
expect_selfie(customer.first_name).to_be("Fred")
```

To use `cache_selfie`, you pass a ***function** that **returns a value*** to snapshot.

```python
cache_selfie(lambda: customer.first_name).to_be("Fred")
```

When selfie is in read mode, it can ignore the function and just return the value within the `to_be` call. When selfie is in write mode, it calls the function and sets the snapshot to that result.

You control whether a given value is being read or written using the `_TODO`, `//selfieonce`, `//SELFIEWRITE` mechanism described in the [quickstart](./get-started#quickstart).

## Benefits and hazards

In the examples above, we aren't doing anything with the return value, which is usually a mistake. The benefit of `cache_selfie` is that we can take an expensive non-deterministic operation, and build a cheap deterministic test on top of the cached value.

The hazard is that the cached result _is not testing the function call anymore_. It is just a convenient way to generate sample data for testing _other_ parts of the system.

```python
brittle_assumption = cache_selfie(lambda: expensive_operation()).to_be("sand")
build_stuff_on(brittle_assumption)
```

Perhaps the `to_be` snapshot was recorded a year ago, and the `expensive_operation` has changed since then. Perhaps someone manually edited the recorded snapshot, and `expensive_operation` has never returned a value anything like the snapshot. ***The function being cached is not being tested.***

If you have a test with multiple `cache_selfie` calls, avoid using `_TODO`. You can have a situation where you recorded the ending of a test, and then later changed the beginning with `_TODO`. The ending won't update itself automatically, so you might cache an inconsistent state. You can avoid this problem by only using `#selfieonce` and `#SELFIEWRITE`.

## Strings and binary

You have these choices for specifying the data in a snapshot:

```python
cache_selfie(lambda: "string").to_be("string")
cache_selfie(lambda: "string").to_match_disk()
cache_selfie_binary(lambda: bytearray[3]).to_be_base64("AAAA")
cache_selfie_binary(lambda: bytearray[3]).to_be_file("pkg/someFile.ext")
cache_selfie_binary(lambda: bytearray[3]).to_match_disk()
```

The `to_match_disk` method is nice because Selfie will garbage-collect the snapshot if it isn't being used, you can "set it and forget it". `to_be` is nice to read inline with the code, and `to_be_file` is nice because you can open the result in external programs.

## Roundtripping typed data

Oftentimes you want to snapshot something besides just a string or binary. For that there is:

```python
class Roundtrip(Generic[T, SerializedForm]):
  def serialize(self, value: T) -> SerializedForm:
    """Serialize a value of type T to its SerializedForm."""
    raise NotImplementedError

  def parse(self, serialized: SerializedForm) -> T:
    """Parse the SerializedForm back to type T."""
    raise NotImplementedError
```

But you don't have to implement `Roundtrip` yourself. You can do `cache_selfie_json`, and `Roundtrip` will be implemented by `json.dumps` and `json.loads`.

And of course, you can also write your own `Roundtrip` implementation, it's only two functions.

Since we used `to_be_file`, we can open `self-portrait.png` in Mac Preview / Windows Explorer.
