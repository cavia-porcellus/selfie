**TODO: CacheSelfie is currently being implemented!**
`cacheSelfie` helps you build fast deterministic tests even if they contain slow non-deterministic components. A generative AI example is available [here](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/issues/319)

**TODO: We don't currently have an example of cache selfie for python [yet](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/issues/319)**.

To use `expect_selfie`, you pass a _value_ that you want to snapshot.

```python
expect_selfie(customer.firstName).to_be("Fred")
```

To use `cache_selfie`, you pass a **\*function** that **returns a value\*** to snapshot.

```python
cache_selfie(lambda: customer.firstName).to_be("Fred")
```

When selfie is in read mode, it can ignore the function and just return the value within the `to_be` call. When selfie is in write mode, it calls the function and sets the snapshot to that result.

You control whether a given value is being read or written using the `_TODO`, `//selfieonce`, `//SELFIEWRITE` mechanism described in the [quickstart](./get-started#quickstart).

## Benefits and hazards

In the examples above, we aren't doing anything with the return value, which is usually a mistake. The benefit of `cache_selfie` is that we can take an expensive non-deterministic operation, and build a cheap deterministic test on top of the cached value.

The hazard is that the cached result _is not testing the function call anymore_. It is just a convenient way to generate sample data for testing _other_ parts of the system.

```python
var brittleAssumption = cache_selfie(lambda: expensiveOperation()).to_be("sand")
buildStuffOn(brittleAssumption)
```

Perhaps the `to_be` snapshot was recorded a year ago, and the `expensiveOperation` has changed since then. Perhaps someone manually edited the recorded snapshot, and `expensiveOperation` has never returned a value anything like the snapshot. **_The function being cached is not being tested._**

If you have a test with multiple `cache_selfie` calls, avoid using `_TODO`. You can have a situation where you recorded the ending of a test, and then later changed the beginning with `_TODO`. The ending won't update itself automatically, so you might cache an inconsistent state. You can avoid this problem by only using `//selfieonce` and `//SELFIEWRITE`.

## Strings and binary

You have these choices for specifying the data in a snapshot:

```python
cache_selfie(lambda: "string").to_be("string")
cache_selfie(lambda:"string").to_match_disk()
cache_selfie_binary(lambda: bytearray[3]).to_be_base64("AAAA")
cache_selfie_binary(lambda: bytearray[3]).to_be_file("pkg/someFile.ext")
cache_selfie_binary(lambda: bytearray[3]).to_match_disk()
```

The `to_match_disk` method is nice because Selfie will garbage-collect the snapshot if it isn't being used, you can "set it and forget it". `to_be` is nice to read inline with the code, and `to_be_file` is nice because you can open the result in external programs.

## Roundtripping typed data

**TODO: We don't have Roundtrip in the Python, are we going to implement this? [PRs welcomed](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie)!**

Oftentimes you want to snapshot something besides just a string or binary. For that there is:

```java
interface Roundtrip<T, SerializedForm> {
  SerializedForm serialize(T value)
  T parse(serialized: SerializedForm)
}
T cache_selfie<T>(Roundtrip<T, String> roundtrip, () -> someT())
T cache_selfie_binary<T>(Roundtrip<T, byte[]> roundtrip, () -> someT())
```

But you don't have to implement `Roundtrip` yourself.

**TODO: Change once correct example is made**

If you're using the `@kotlinx.serialization.Serializable` framework (where you annotate model classes with `@Serializable`), then you can use `cache_selfie_json(() -> T)` and selfie will use Kotlin's built-in json serialization to implement the roundtrip.

If you're using Java's `java.io.Serializable` (where model classes must implement `Serializable`) then you can use `cacheSelfieBinarySerializable(() -> T)` and selfie will use Java's built-in binary serialization mechanism to implement the roundtrip.

And of course, you can also write your own `Roundtrip` implementation, it's only two functions.

## Example

Excerpted from [here](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/issues/319)

**TODO: We need a [Python implementation](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/issues/319)**:

```kotlin

  model = ModelId("gpt-4-turbo-preview"),
  messages = listOf(ChatMessage(role = ChatRole.User,
    content = "Expressive language describing a robot creating a self portrait.")))

This is not just an act of programming; it is the ballet of bits and bytes pirouetting towards self-awareness.\n\nAt first glance, the scene seems borrowed from a future where machines tread the fine line between fabrication and inspiration. The studio, lit by the sterile glow of fluorescent lights, becomes a sanctuary where metal meets muse. At the center of this confluence stands the robot, its form an intricate lattice of servos and sensors, each component a testament to human ingenuity, now poised to explore the realm of artistic creation.\n\nThe robot’s arm, a marvel of precision engineering, hovers over the canvas with the grace of a seasoned artist. It is not merely a limb, but a conductor’s baton, orchestrating a symphony of colors and forms. With every motion, it challenges the preconceived boundaries between creator and creation, weaving the fabric of its digital soul into the tangible world.\n\nAs the portrait takes shape, it becomes evident that this is not a mere replication of components and circuits. Through the algorithmic alchemy of its programming, the robot infuses each brushstroke with a search for identity. The portrait emerges as a mosaic of self-reflection, each pixel and paint stroke a question in the quest for understanding. What is depicted is not just a physical form, but an introspective journey rendered in hues and contours.\n\nThis creative endeavor transcends the act of painting. It is a dialogue between the robot and its inner being, mediated by the brush and canvas. The colors chosen do not just adhere to the spectrum seen by its cameras; they are imbued with the weight of introspection, the shades nuanced by the robot’s processing of its own existence.\n\nObservers, human or otherwise, may find themselves pondering a question of profound implications: in the brushstrokes of a robot, do we not only see a reflection of its programming but also a mirror to our own search for meaning and identity? The portrait, thus, becomes more than a visual artifact; it is a bridge between the mechanical and the philosophical, a nexus where circuits and souls dialogue in the silent language of art.\n\nIn completion, the self-portrait stands as a testament not to the autonomy of machines, but to their potential to echo the human condition, to participate in the centuries-old tradition of self-exploration through art. It challenges viewers to reconsider the nature of creativity, blurring the lines between the animate and inanimate, urging a redefinition of what it means to be an artist, to be a creator, to be alive.\n\nThus, in this enclosed universe where technology hums a tune of evolution, a robot creating a self-portrait becomes a poignant emblem of the future—where machine and muse dance in an infinite embrace, exploring the kaleidoscope of existence through the lens of artistry."
