To start snapshot testing in Python, all you need is to add a single dependency.

## Installation

### Requirements

Selfie requires Python 3.9 or newer. It has plugins for the following Python test runners:

- Pytest via `pytest-selfie` ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-selfie/), [changelog](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/blob/main/python/CHANGELOG.md))
- PRs welcome for other test runners (see [here](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/issues/350) for a guide)

## Quickstart

_If you haven't seen the [GIF on our GitHub](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie), you might want to watch that first (give us a ‚≠ê while you're at it üòâ)._

Let's say we have the following test code:

```python
expect_selfie([1, 2, 3]).to_be_TODO()
```

If you run this test, selfie will rewrite your sourcecode to be this:

```python
expect_selfie([1, 2, 3]).to_be([1, 2, 3])
```

Now, let's change the code to this:

```python
expect_selfie("oops").to_be([1, 2, 3])
```

When we run the test, we will get a failure, and the failure message will be:

```
Snapshot mismatch
- update this snapshot by adding `_TODO` to the function name
- update all snapshots in this file by adding `#selfieonce` or `#SELFIEWRITE`
```

As you can see, we have three options:

- replace `to_be` with `to_be_TODO` (you can leave or remove the `[1, 2, 3]`, makes no difference)
  - rewrites only this one snapshot, and selfie will remove the `_TODO`
- put `#selfieonce` anywhere in the file
  - rewrites all snapshots in the file, and selfie will remove `#selfieonce` after it has done so
- put `#SELFIEWRITE` anywhere in that file
  - rewrites all snapshots in the file until you remove `#SELFIEWRITE` yourself

## Disk

To store a snapshot on disk, swap `toBe` for `to_match_disk`:

```python
expect_selfie([1, 2, 3]).to_match_disk_TODO()
```

This will create a file called `SomethingOrOther.ss` in the same directory as your test. It will also rewrite the test source to:

```python
expect_selfie([1, 2, 3]).to_match_disk()
```

Just like inline literal snapshots, you can use `_TODO`, `#selfieonce`, and `#SELFIEWRITE` to control how the snapshots are written and updated. You don't have to use `_TODO` if you have the `#selfieonce` or `#SELFIEWRITE` comments in your file.

If you want the disk snapshots to live in a different folder, set `snapshotFolderName` using [SelfieSettings](https://pydoc.selfie.dev/namespacepytest__selfie_1_1SelfieSettingsAPI).

## CI

The nice thing about `#SELFIEWRITE` is that all of your snapshots will update on every run, which makes it easy to explore ‚Äî like multiassert on steroids. **The bad thing about `#SELFIEWRITE` is that all of the tests always pass, even if the snapshots actually change on every run.**

For example, you might have a realtime timestamp or a random port number embedded in a snapshot. Randomness and realtime cannot be present in a repeatable assertion, and you might not realize that a tiny part of a large snapshot is changing while you're in `#SELFIEWRITE` mode.

For this reason, it is critical that a CI server should always run in `readonly` mode. No action is needed on your part, selfie automatically puts itself into `readonly` mode if the `CI=true` environment variable is present, which is true for all popular CI systems.

When in `readonly` mode, selfie not only refuses to update any snapshots, it also fails the build if `_TODO`, `#selfieonce`, or `#SELFIEWRITE` are present in the sourcecode, even if the snapshots were correct. Writing snapshots is a strictly private affair üòè.

## Overwrite everything

Selfie has three modes:

- `interactive`, the default mode, which we discussed in the [quickstart](#quickstart)
- `readonly`, the default mode if `CI=true`, where no snapshots can be written
- `overwrite`, where every snapshot is overwritten, regardless of whether it is `_TODO` or not

To set the mode, you set the `selfie` or `SELFIE` environment variable or system property to either `interactive`, `readonly`, or `overwrite`. But in the vast majority of cases, it's best to leave it alone and let the defaults do their thing.

## Strings, repr, and more

If you call `repr(x)` on some variable `x`, Python will return a string that represents the underlying value. This string is what selfie uses to stuff a value inside the brackets of `to_be()`.

All of the examples so far have asserted on the string returned by `repr`. But selfie also has special handling for byte arrays (`bytes`).

```python
expect_selfie(10/4).to_be(2.5)
expect_selfie((10/4) == 2.5).to_be(True)

# saves as base64 within a subsection of a `.ss` file, with garbage collection for unused sections
expect_selfie(bytearray(100)).to_match_disk()

# base64 assertion
expect_selfie(bytearray(100)).to_be_base64("blahblah") 

# raw local file, no garbage collection
expect_selfie(generatePngFile()).to_be_file("you_can_open_image_locally.png") 
```

But the real power of selfie is asserting on arbitrary objects using **facets**, which are covered in more detail [in their own section](/py/facets).
