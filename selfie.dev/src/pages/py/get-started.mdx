TODO: adapt this to Python

To start snapshot testing in Python, all you need is to add a [single dependency](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-selfie/).

## Installation

### Requirements

Selfie snapshot testing works with the following Python test runners:

- Pytest
- PRs welcome for other test runners

Both disk and inline snapshots can be used with Python test code.

### Poetry

Dependencies are managed using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer),
then just cd into `selfie-lib` and `run poetry install`.

Replace `ver_SELFIE` with the [latest available version of selfie](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/blob/main/python/CHANGELOG.md).

## Quickstart

_If you haven't seen the [GIF on our GitHub](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie), you might want to watch that first (give us a ‚≠ê while you're at it üòâ)._

Let's say we have the following test code:

```python
expect_selfie([1, 2, 3]).to_be_TODO()
```

If you run this test, selfie will rewrite your sourcecode to be this:

```python
expect_selfie([1, 2, 3]).to_be("[1, 2, 3]")
```

Now, let's change the code to this:

```python
expect_selfie("oops").to_be("[1, 2, 3]")
```

When we run the test, we will get a failure, and the failure message will be:

```
Snapshot mismatch
- update this snapshot by adding `_TODO` to the function name
- update all snapshots in this file by adding `//selfieonce` or `//SELFIEWRITE`
```

As you can see, we have three options:

- replace `to_be` with `to_be_TODO` (you can leave or remove the `"[1, 2, 3]"`, makes no difference)
  - rewrites only this one snapshot, and selfie will remove the `_TODO`
- put `//selfieonce` anywhere in the file
  - rewrites all snapshots in the file, and selfie will remove `//selfieonce` after it has done so
- put `//SELFIEWRITE` anywhere in that file
  - rewrites all snapshots in the file until you remove `//SELFIEWRITE` yourself

## Disk

To store a snapshot on disk, swap `toBe` for `to_match_disk`:

```python
expect_selfie([1, 2, 3]).to_match_disk_TODO()
```

This will create a file called `SomethingOrOther.ss` in the same directory as your test. It will also rewrite the test source to:

```python
expect_selfie([1, 2, 3]).to_match_disk()
```

Just like inline literal snapshots, you can use `_TODO`, `//selfieonce`, and `//SELFIEWRITE` to control how the snapshots are written and updated. You don't have to use `_TODO` if you have the `//selfieonce` or `//SELFIEWRITE` comments in your file.

If you want the disk snapshots to live in a different folder, set `snapshotFolderName` using [SelfieSettings](https://pydoc.selfie.dev/namespacepytest__selfie_1_1SelfieSettingsAPI).

## CI

The nice thing about `//SELFIEWRITE` is that all of your snapshots will update on every run, which makes it easy to explore ‚Äî like multiassert on steroids. **The bad thing about `//SELFIEWRITE` is that all of the tests always pass, even if the snapshots actually change on every run.**

For example, you might have a realtime timestamp or a random port number embedded in a snapshot. Randomness and realtime cannot be present in a repeatable assertion, and you might not realize that a tiny part of a large snapshot is changing while you're in `//SELFIEWRITE` mode.

For this reason, it is critical that a CI server should always run in `readonly` mode. No action is needed on your part, selfie automatically puts itself into `readonly` mode if the `CI=true` environment variable is present, which is true for all popular CI systems.

When in `readonly` mode, selfie not only refuses to update any snapshots, it also fails the build if `_TODO`, `//selfieonce`, or `//SELFIEWRITE` are present in the sourcecode, even if the snapshots were correct. Writing snapshots is a strictly private affair üòè.

## Overwrite everything

Selfie has three modes:

- `interactive`, the default mode, which we discussed in the [quickstart](#quickstart)
- `readonly`, the default mode if `CI=true`, where no snapshots can be written
- `overwrite`, where every snapshot is overwritten, regardless of whether it is `_TODO` or not

To set the mode, you set the `selfie` or `SELFIE` environment variable or system property to either `interactive`, `readonly`, or `overwrite`. But in the vast majority of cases, it's best to leave it alone and let the defaults do their thing.

**TODO: Change once available**

```console
[MAVEN]
user@machine repo % mvn test -Dselfie=overwrite

[GRADLE (only works if you followed the install instructions above re: environment)]
user@machine repo % ./gradlew test -Pselfie=overwrite
```

## Beyond toString

All of the examples so far have asserted on Strings. You can also do inline literal assertions on primitive values, and disk assertions on byte arrays:

```python
expect_selfie(10/4).to_be(2.5)
expect_selfie((10/4) == 2.5).to_be(true)
expect_selfie(bytearray(100)).to_match_disk()
```

But the real power of selfie is asserting on arbitrary objects using **facets**, which are covered in the [advanced section](/py/facets).

## Reference

Full API documentation is available at [pydoc.selfie.dev](https://pydoc.selfie.dev).

- `.to_be_TODO()` or `.to_be_TODO(argumentIsIgnored)`
  - creates or updates an inline literal snapshot
- `.to_match_disk_TODO()`
  - creates or updates a disk snapshot
- `//selfieonce`
  - all snapshots in the file will be updated, whether they are `_TODO` or not
  - selfie will remove the comment after the snapshots have updated
- `//SELFIEWRITE`
  - all snapshots in the file will be updated, whether they are `_TODO` or not
  - selfie will not remove the comment after the snapshots have updated
- mode is set by the `SELFIE` environment variable or system property
  - `interactive`, default
  - `readonly`, default if `CI` environment variable is `true`
  - `overwrite`, all snapshots can be overwritten
- `Camera` and `Lens` are covered in the [advanced section](/py/facets).
