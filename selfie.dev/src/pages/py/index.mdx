This is a reasonable way to test.

```python
def test_primes_below_100():
    result = primes_below(100)
    assert result[:4] == [2, 3, 5, 7]
    assert result[-2:] == [89, 97]
```

But oftentimes a more useful way to test is actually:

```python
def test_mc_test_face():
    print(primes_below(100))
```

With literal snapshots, you can `println` directly into your testcode, combining the speed and freedom of `println` with the repeatability and collaborative spirit of conventional assertions.

```python
def test_primes_below_100():
  expect_selfie(primes_below(100)).to_be_TODO()
```

When you run the test, selfie will automatically rewrite `_TODO()` into whatever it turned out to be.

```python
def test_primes_below100():
  expect_selfie(primes_below(100))
    .to_be("[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]")
```

And from now on it's a proper assertion, but you didn't have to spend any time writing it. It's not only less work, but also more complete than the usual `.startsWith().endsWith()` rigamarole.

## NOT READY YET - WIP

That `primes_below(100)` snapshot above is almost too long. Something bigger, such as `primes_below(10_000)` is definitely too big. To handle this, selfie lets you put your snapshots on disk.

```python
def test_gzip_favicon():
    expect_selfie(get("/favicon.ico", ContentEncoding.GZIP)).to_match_disk()

def test_order_flow():
  expect_selfie(get("/orders")).to_match_disk("initial")
  post_order()
  expect_selfie(get("/orders")).to_match_disk("ordered")
```

This will generate a snapshot file like so:

```html
╔═ gzipFavicon ═╗ base64 length 12 bytes 
Umlja1JvbGwuanBn
╔═ orderFlow/initial ═╗
<html>
  <body>
    <button>Submit order</button>
  </body>
</html>
╔═ orderFlow/ordered ═╗
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Thanks for your business!</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Order information</summary>
      <p>Tracking #ABC123</p>
    </details>
  </body>
</html>
```

Selfie's snapshot files `.ss` are simple to parse, just split them up on `\n╔═`. Escaping rules only come into play if the content you are escaping has lines that start with `╔`, and you can always use `selfie-lib` as a parser if you want.

You can treat your snapshot files as an output deliverable of your code, and use them as an input to other tooling.

## NOT READY YET - WIP

A problem with the snapshots we've shown so far is that they are one dimensional. What about headers and cookies? What about the content the user actually sees, without all the markup? What if we could do this?

```
╔═ orderFlow/initial [md] ═╗
Submit order
╔═ orderFlow/ordered [md] ═╗
Thanks for your business!</p>
```

Well, you can! Every snapshot has a _subject_, which is the main thing you are recording. And that subject can have any number of _facets_, which are named views of the subject from a different lens.

```python
html = "<html>..."
snapshot = Snapshot(html).plus_facet("md", parse_html_to_md(html))
expect_selfie(snapshot).to_match_disk()
```

You can also use facets in combination with disk and inline literal snapshots to make your tests more like a story.

```python
def test_order_flow():
  expect_selfie(get("/orders")).to_match_disk("initial")
    .facet("md").to_be("Submit order")
  post_order()
  expect_selfie(get("/orders")).to_match_disk("ordered")
    .facet("md").to_be("Thanks for your business!")
```

Selfie's faceting is built around [Camera](https://kdoc.selfie.dev/selfie-lib/com.diffplug.selfie/-camera/), [Lens](https://kdoc.selfie.dev/selfie-lib/com.diffplug.selfie/-lens/), and [Snapshot](https://kdoc.selfie.dev/selfie-lib/com.diffplug.selfie/-snapshot/), whose API is roughly:

```python
class Snapshot:
  subject: SnapshotValue
  facets: frozendict[str, SnapshotValue]

class Lens(ABC) :
  def transform(self, snapshot: Snapshot) -> Snapshot:
    pass

class Camera(Generic [T]):
  def snapshot(self, subject: T) -> Snapshot:
    pass
  def with_lens(self, lens: Lens) -> 'Camera':
    # returns a new Camera which applies the given lens to every snapshot
```

See the [facets section](/py/facets) for more details on how you can use Selfie for snapshot testing with Java, Kotlin, or any JVM language.

## NOT READY YET - WIP

Sometimes a test has a component which is slow, expensive, or non-deterministic. In cases like this, it can be useful to save the result of a previous execution of the API call, and use that as a mock for future tests.

```python
client = expensive_ai_service()
chat_response = cache_selfie(client.chat("What's your favorite number today?")).to_be("Since it's March 14, my favorite number is π")
# build other stuff with the chat response
```

You can cache simple strings, but you can also cache typed API objects, binary data, or anything else you can serialize to a string or a byte array.

```python
imageBytes = cache_selfie_binary(() -> {
  return client.generate_image("A robot making a self portrait")
}).to_be_file("selfie.png")
```

For more information on how to use `cache_selfie`, see the [cache example](/py/cache).
