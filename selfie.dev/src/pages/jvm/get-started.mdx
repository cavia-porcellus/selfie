To start snapshot testing in Java or any JVM language, all you need is to add a [single dependency](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.diffplug.selfie/selfie-runner-junit5).

## Installation

### Requirements

Selfie snapshot testing works with the following JVM test runners:

- JUnit5
- JUnit4 through junit-vintage
- [Kotest (with JUnit5 or Kotlin Multiplatform)](./kotest)
- PRs welcome for other test runners

Disk snapshots can be used with any JVM language, but inline literal snapshots only work if the test code is written in:

- java (8+ is okay, but 15+ is recommended)
- kotlin
- groovy
- scala

Adding support for other languages is [straightforward](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/blob/main/jvm/selfie-lib/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/diffplug/selfie/guts/Literals.kt), PRs are welcome!

### Maven

If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.diffplug.selfie</groupId>
    <artifactId>selfie-runner-junit5</artifactId>
    <version>${ver_SELFIE}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Replace `ver_SELFIE` with the [latest available version of selfie](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/blob/main/jvm/CHANGELOG.md).

### Gradle

For Gradle users, add this to your `build.gradle` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  // ... other dependencies
  testImplementation "com.diffplug.selfie:selfie-runner-junit5:$ver_SELFIE"
}
test {
  useJUnitPlatform()
  environment project.properties.subMap(["selfie"]) // optional, see "Overwrite everything" below
  inputs.files(fileTree("src/test") { // optional, improves up-to-date checking
    include "**/*.ss"
  })
}
```

or this to `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  testImplementation("com.diffplug.selfie:selfie-runner-junit5:${project.properties["ver_SELFIE"]}")
}
tasks.test {
  useJUnitPlatform()
  environment(properties.filter { it.key == "selfie" }) // optional, see "Overwrite everything" below
  inputs.files(fileTree("src/test") { // optional, improves up-to-date checking
    include("**/*.ss")
  })
}
```

Replace `ver_SELFIE` with the [latest available version of selfie](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/blob/main/jvm/CHANGELOG.md).

## Quickstart

*If you haven't seen the [GIF on our GitHub](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie), you might want to watch that first (give us a ‚≠ê while you're at it üòâ).*

Let's say we have the following test code:

```java
expectSelfie(List.of(1, 2, 3).toString()).toBe_TODO();
```

If you run this test, selfie will rewrite your sourcecode to be this:

```java
expectSelfie(List.of(1, 2, 3).toString()).toBe("[1, 2, 3]");
```

Now, let's change the code to this:

```java
expectSelfie("oops").toBe("[1, 2, 3]");
```

When we run the test, we will get a failure, and the failure message will be:

```
Snapshot mismatch
- update this snapshot by adding `_TODO` to the function name
- update all snapshots in this file by adding `//selfieonce` or `//SELFIEWRITE`
```

As you can see, we have three options:

- replace `toBe` with `toBe_TODO` (you can leave or remove the `"[1, 2, 3]"`, makes no difference)
  - rewrites only this one snapshot, and selfie will remove the `_TODO`
- put `//selfieonce` anywhere in the file
  - rewrites all snapshots in the file, and selfie will remove `//selfieonce` after it has done so
- put `//SELFIEWRITE` anywhere in that file
  - rewrites all snapshots in the file until you remove `//SELFIEWRITE` yourself

## Disk

To store a snapshot on disk, swap `toBe` for `toMatchDisk`:

```java
expectSelfie(List.of(1, 2, 3).toString()).toMatchDisk_TODO();
```

This will create a file called `SomethingOrOther.ss` in the same directory as your test. It will also rewrite the test source to:

```java
expectSelfie(List.of(1, 2, 3).toString()).toMatchDisk();
```

Just like inline literal snapshots, you can use  `_TODO`, `//selfieonce`, and `//SELFIEWRITE` to control how the snapshots are written and updated. You don't have to use `_TODO` if you have the `//selfieonce` or `//SELFIEWRITE` comments in your file.

If you want the disk snapshots to live in a different folder, set `snapshotFolderName` using [SelfieSettings](https://kdoc.selfie.dev/selfie-runner-junit5/com.diffplug.selfie.junit5/-selfie-settings-a-p-i/).

## CI

The nice thing about `//SELFIEWRITE` is that all of your snapshots will update on every run, which makes it easy to explore ‚Äî like multiassert on steroids. **The bad thing about `//SELFIEWRITE` is that all of the tests always pass, even if the snapshots actually change on every run.**

For example, you might have a realtime timestamp or a random port number embedded in a snapshot. Randomness and realtime cannot be present in a repeatable assertion, and you might not realize that a tiny part of a large snapshot is changing while you're in `//SELFIEWRITE` mode.

For this reason, it is critical that a CI server should always run in `readonly` mode. No action is needed on your part, selfie automatically puts itself into `readonly` mode if the `CI=true` environment variable is present, which is true for all popular CI systems.

When in `readonly` mode, selfie not only refuses to update any snapshots, it also fails the build if `_TODO`, `//selfieonce`, or `//SELFIEWRITE` are present in the sourcecode, even if the snapshots were correct. Writing snapshots is a strictly private affair üòè.

## Overwrite everything

Selfie has three modes:

- `interactive`, the default mode, which we discussed in the [quickstart](#quickstart)
- `readonly`, the default mode if `CI=true`, where no snapshots can be written
- `overwrite`, where every snapshot is overwritten, regardless of whether it is `_TODO` or not

To set the mode, you set the `selfie` or `SELFIE` environment variable or system property to either `interactive`, `readonly`, or `overwrite`. But in the vast majority of cases, it's best to leave it alone and let the defaults do their thing.

```console
[MAVEN]
user@machine repo % mvn test -Dselfie=overwrite

[GRADLE (only works if you followed the install instructions)]
user@machine repo % ./gradlew test -Pselfie=overwrite
```

In Gradle, you can also go to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` and add `selfie=overwrite`. Now snapshots will always overwrite on your machine (for every test task which was setup properly).

```kotlin
test {
  environment project.properties.subMap(["selfie"]) // build.gradle
  environment(properties.filter { it.key == "selfie" }) // build.gradle.kts
}
```

## Beyond toString

All of the examples so far have asserted on Strings. You can also do inline literal assertions on primitive values, and disk assertions on byte arrays:

```java 
expectSelfie(10/4).toBe(2);
expectSelfie((10/4) == 2).toBe(true);
expectSelfie(TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis(365*1_000_000L)).toBe(31_536_000_000_000_000L);
expectSelfie(new byte[100]).toMatchDisk();
```

But the real power of selfie is asserting on arbitrary objects using **facets**, which are covered in the [facets section](/jvm/facets).
