# Contributing to Selfie

- To improve our webpage go to [`selfie.dev/README.md`](selfie.dev/README.md)
- To improve our Python, go to [`python/README.md`](python/README.md)
- To improve our JVM, Javascript, or WASM implementations, go to [`jvm/README.md`](jvm/README.md)
  - To improve the webpage of our published kdoc, [kdoc.selfie.dev](https://kdoc.selfie.dev), go to [`jvm/gradle/dokka/README.md`](jvm/gradle/dokka/README.md)
- To contribute for a different platform (python, go, etc.) we're happy to help! It should probably live in a different repo until it's close to `1.0`, but once it's near completion we're happy to maintain it here if you would like. Discuss in [selfie#85](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/issues/85), but also feel free to open a PR with any ideas you have.

Pull requests are very welcome, preferably against `main`.
